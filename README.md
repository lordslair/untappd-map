# UntappdMap, the project :

This project is mainly a PoC about using the Twitter API, data from Untappd, and SVG maps.  
All of this inside a Docker container for portable purposes.

Actually, as 1.0, it works this way, as soon as you send your Untappd username to the script via twitter :

 - Fetch Country of origin for the beers you've drink on Untappd
 - Sort the data and pick colors accordingly with count
 - Edit a SVG world map (from [Wikimedia][WIKImap])
 - Convert the SVG into PNG
 - Reply to your tweet with the PNG as media

v1.1 introduced a second reply, with a Top10 of Countries using Flag Emoji  

### Which script does what ?

I added multiples test scripts as I was coding this to help me, ant test almost every function independantly.  
They are located in /test/ folder.

```

```

### Tech

I used mainy :

* Perl - as a lazy animal
* [Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1;][CPANTwitt] - Easy Twitter API implementation
* [Image::LibRSVG][CPANrSVG] - SVG to PNG conversion
* [Locale::Country] - Translation from <Countryname> to ALPHA-2 code
* [Emoji::NationalFlag] - Translation from <ALPHA-2> to Emoji
* [YAML::Tiny] - THE easy way to deal with YAML files

And of course GitHub to store all these shenanigans. 

### Installation

The script is aimed to run in a Docker container. Could work without it, but more practical this way.  

```
git clone https://github.com/lordslair/untappd-map
cd untappd-map
docker build --no-cache -t lordslair/untappd-map .
```

```
# docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            SIZE

lordslair/untappd-map   alpine              9c6a2c97fed3        68.87 MB
```

```
docker run --name untappd-map -d lordslair/untappd-map
```

```
docker ps

#### Disclaimer/Reminder

>As there's only one script running, it's not wrapped in a start.sh-like script.  
>There's proably **NULL** interest for anyone to clone it and run the script this way, though.  
>(It's currently hardcoded to use @UntappdMap Twitter account I registered)  
>I put the code here mostly for reminder, and to help anyone if they find parts of it useful for their own dev.

### Result

Random generated Choropleth (script included in /test/)  

![World][Screenshot-Map-small]

Invoked on twitter, and the answer with map, and Top10  

![Twitter answer][Screenshot-Twitter]

### Todos

 - New types of maps
 - ~~lighter container (empty it weights 175M) [Done in 1.06 with Alpine]~~
 - ~~logs accessible from outside the container (docker logs stuff)~~
 - /data accessible from outside the container (docker volume stuff)

### Useful stuff
